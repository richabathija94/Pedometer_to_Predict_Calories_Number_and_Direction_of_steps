# Pedometer_to_Predict_Number_Calories_and_Direction_of_steps
This is project explores all aspects of the IoT product life-cycle. These aspects include: (i) interfacing with devices (sensors/actuators) that collect data and affect the environment; (ii) exploring network protocols for communication with these devices; (iii) programming to backend services that supplement this data; and (iv) developing apps that facilitate human interaction with these devices and analysis of the data they produce. Security, privacy and performance considerations specific to the IoT will also be explored. 
## Tools Used:
Specific technologies studied include lightweight devices like the **MicroBit** and **Raspberry Pi**; device-level standards like **BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)** and **WiFi**; and application protocols such as **MQTT and CoAP**. Programming has been done in combinations of **Python and Java**. Prediction of steps has been using **Linear Regression** using a dataset generated by logging in real time steps each day and the **Weather API**, prediction of direction has been done using the **Accelerometer** function in Microbit, and the calories have been calculated using a formula.
