# Pedometer_to_Predict_Number_Calories_and_Direction_of_steps
This is project explores all aspects of the IoT product life-cycle. These aspects include: (i) interfacing with devices (sensors/actuators) that collect data and affect the environment; (ii) exploring network protocols for communication with these devices; (iii) programming to backend services that supplement this data; and (iv) developing apps that facilitate human interaction with these devices and analysis of the data they produce. Security, privacy and performance considerations specific to the IoT will also be explored. 
## Tools Used:
Specific technologies studied include lightweight devices like the uBit and Raspberry Pi; device-level standards like BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) and WiFi; and application protocols such as MQTT and CoAP. Programming will be in combinations of python and java
